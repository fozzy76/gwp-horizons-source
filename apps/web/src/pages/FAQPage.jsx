      {
        question: "What materials are available?",
        answer: "Lynn offers three premium print substrates: Acrylic (vivid color, glass-like depth, modern look), Metal (high contrast, dramatic finish, ideal for bold wildlife images), and Canvas (warm, classic gallery feel). All materials are museum-quality and produced by MerchOne."
      },
      {
        question: "Are the prints archival quality?",
        answer: "Yes. All prints are produced using archival-grade inks and materials designed to last decades without fading when properly displayed. Avoid direct sunlight for best longevity."
      },
      {
        question: "Do prints come ready to hang?",
        answer: "Prints are sold unframed. Lynn has kept the product line focused on the print itself so customers can choose framing that suits their space and style."
      },
      {
        question: "What sizes are available?",
        answer: "Sizes vary by material and photo. Available sizes are shown on each individual product page. If you need a specific size not listed, contact Lynn directly."

        question: "Is my payment information secure?",
        answer: "Yes. All payments are processed by Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor. Your card information is never stored on our servers."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I change or cancel my order?",
        answer: "Orders are sent to our print fulfillment partner immediately after payment is confirmed. If you need to make a change, contact Lynn as soon as possible at lynn@greatwildlifephotos.com. We cannot guarantee changes once production has begun."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer discounts or promotions?",
        answer: "Subscribe to the newsletter to be the first to know about new photo releases and any special offers."

      },

        question: "How long does shipping take?",

      },
      {
        question: "How are prints packaged?",

      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: "Returns & Damage",
    items: [
      {
        question: "Do you accept returns?",
        answer: "Because each print is produced on demand specifically for your order, we do not accept returns. Please review your size and material selection carefully before placing your order."
      },
      {
        question: "What if my print arrives damaged?",
        answer: "If your print arrives damaged, contact Lynn at lynn@greatwildlifephotos.com within 7 days of delivery. Please include a clear photo of the damage. We will arrange a replacement print at no charge - we stand behind every order."
